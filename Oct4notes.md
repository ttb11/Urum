# October 4 Meeting notes

## Agenda
* TEI and initial markup
* Research Question
* Github
* Project Site
* Goals for next time

## Decisions
We do want to pursue TEI markup, which will make the project more flexible, useful, and simple.
Leipzig and Interlinear glossing as part of the presentation and also the research.
Research question focuses on possibility of Turkish functioning as a "bridge" to translate into Urum, which is a dying language.
Web development will fall to Tyler, markup will fall to Justin.
Setting up Filezilla

## Goals
Get your pdf turned into an XML file (using Calibre)
Figure out which TEI elements you'd like to use, and how much of the text you're going to use.
Create an initial splash page.

We should be done with these things by Wednesday, October 11.
